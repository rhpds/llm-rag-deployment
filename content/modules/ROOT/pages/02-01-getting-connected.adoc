For the purposes of this training session, we have provisioned a single {ocp} cluster, with {rhoai} deployed on it.

Each person attending this lab will have a unique user account in which to do their work.

== Environment information

__Note: if you are using the lab-deployed instructions, the values below will render properly. If not, like when using the rendered instructions from the Github repo, placeholder values will appear.__

* Your account id: `{user}`
* Your password: `{password}`

In a new window or tab, open the following URL and log in:

* The {rhoai} Dashboard URL for our shared environment:
** https://rhods-dashboard-redhat-ods-applications.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/[https://rhods-dashboard-redhat-ods-applications.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/,window=_blank]
* Click on the `Login with OpenShift` button:

* Enter your credentials (as detailed above)
* The result should look like:

* Because the password is so simple (`{password}`), your browser might display a scary message such as:

* It is safe here to ignore this message when it pops up.

* After you authenticate, the result should look like:

If you got this far and saw all that, congratulations, you properly connected to the {rhoai} Dashboard Application!

We are now ready to start the {ic}.

== Getting Support

* If you attend in person, in the room:
** Some very kind colleagues of ours will be walking around in the room, to help and/or answer questions.
** If you run into a particular issue, call out to one of them and quietly explain what the issue is.

* If you attend remotely:
** The organizer will indicate the best way to ask questions, usually through the video conferencing tool.
** Depending on the setup, a Slack channel (or similar) may also be available. Please check with the organizer.
