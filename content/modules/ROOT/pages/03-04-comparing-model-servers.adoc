= Comparing two LLMs
include::_attributes.adoc[]

So far, for this {ic-lab}, we have used the model https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2[Mistral-7B Instruct v2,window=_blank]. Although lighter than other models, it is still quite heavy and we need a large GPU to run it. Would we get as good results with a smaller model running on a CPU only? Let's try!

In this exercise, we'll pitch our previous model against a much smaller LLM called https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-large[flan-t5-large,window=_blank]. We'll compare the results and see if the smaller model is good enough for our use case.

From the `parasol-insurance/lab-materials/03` folder, please open the notebook called `03-04-comparing-model-servers.ipynb` and follow the instructions.

When done, you can close the notebook and head to the next page.
